### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [Timetabl](https://github.com/debater-coder/timetabl-app), a bell time app for Sydney Boys High School. I am also starting to contribute to [`cubing.js`](https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js), a library with modules for displaying and working with twisty puzzles.
