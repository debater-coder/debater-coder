### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“† I'm currently working on [Timetabl](https://github.com/debater-coder/timetabl-app), a bell time app for Sydney Boys High School. 
- ðŸ§© I'm contributing to [`cubing.js`](https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js), a library with modules for displaying and working with twisty puzzles.
- ðŸ¦€ I'm also learning Rust.

#### The language I use the most is `typescript`
