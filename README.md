### Hi there 👋

- 📆 I'm currently working on [Timetabl](https://github.com/debater-coder/timetabl-app), a bell time app for Sydney Boys High School. 
- 🧩 I'm contributing to [`cubing.js`](https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js), a library with modules for displaying and working with twisty puzzles.
- 🦀 I'm also learning Rust.
